# these are the user journey maps I created from personal experience and talking to people. The user journey maps are for a temple, in soecific new devotees, someone who wants to become a donor, and a volunteer signup. This can be scaled to other spiritual/religious organizations but now I need help identifying which channels serve which journeys and prioritizing them by impact as opposed to effort

You already have most of the hard work done in the journey maps; now it’s mainly mapping journeys → channels → priorities.[^1_1]

Below is a concise way to do it for your three journeys (new devotee, donor, volunteer), with impact vs. effort in mind.

***

## 1. New devotee journey

Key stages and touchpoints you identified: Google search, Maps, social media, website, FAQs, event pages, confirmation messages, in‑person greetings, WhatsApp, email newsletters.[^1_1]

### Highest‑impact, must‑invest channels

These are where drop‑offs are currently high and where one improvement affects many people.[^1_1]

- Google Search \& Google Maps
    - Purpose: “Hindu temple near me”, directions, first impression.[^1_1]
    - Impact: Very **high** (nearly all first‑timers). Effort: Medium (one‑time SEO + profile optimization, then periodic updates).
- Website home + “New here?” section
    - Purpose: Set expectations, answer FAQs, show current events, reduce anxiety.[^1_1]
    - Impact: Very high (all serious considerers), Effort: Medium (one strong template, reuse content across events).
- Event detail \& registration pages
    - Purpose: Clarify what/when/where, reduce overwhelm, simplify sign‑up.[^1_1]
    - Impact: High (directly tied to attendance), Effort: Medium (shorter forms, clearer layout, automatic reminders).
- In‑person greeting + WhatsApp invite at first visit
    - Purpose: Turn one‑time visitor into recurring attendee; sense of welcome and belonging.[^1_1]
    - Impact: Very high for retention, Effort: Medium (volunteer training + simple QR workflow).


### Medium‑impact, lower‑effort support channels

- Social media (Instagram reels, short videos) as awareness/top‑of‑funnel.[^1_1]
- Email newsletters for post‑visit nurture and event reminders.[^1_1]

These should support but not replace website + Google + in‑person, which are the main conversion levers.

***

## 2. Donor journey (online content → donor → major donor)

You listed: YouTube/Instagram, website/donation page, email, online payment form, confirmation SMS/email, impact reports, events, personal outreach for major donors.[^1_1]

### Highest‑impact channels

- Donation landing page (with impact stories)
    - Purpose: Move someone from “interested but cautious” to first donation by building trust.[^1_1]
    - Impact: Very **high** (every online donor hits this), Effort: Medium (one good impact page, reused for campaigns).
- Donation/payment flow + confirmation
    - Purpose: Make giving frictionless and reassuring.[^1_1]
    - Impact: Very high (abandonment is a big risk), Effort: Medium (simplify form, offer recurring option, auto thank‑you + receipt).
- Post‑donation impact communications (email, WhatsApp, occasional SMS)
    - Purpose: Turn one‑time donors into recurring and larger donors.[^1_1]
    - Impact: High on retention and upgrades, Effort: Low–Medium (automated sequences, quarterly impact updates).
- Personal outreach for recurring/major donors (phone, 1:1 WhatsApp, in‑person)
    - Purpose: Move “connected and valued” to “committed and proud.”[^1_1]
    - Impact: Very high for a small segment; Effort: High per person but justified by gift size.


### Medium‑impact, lower‑effort support channels

- Social media + YouTube content that consistently includes subtle “Donate / Join” CTAs.[^1_1]
- Email list building (from content viewers/devotees) feeding into the donor funnel.[^1_1]

***

## 3. Volunteer journey

You listed: social media, WhatsApp, in‑person announcements, website volunteer page, FAQ, interest form, confirmation messages, WhatsApp volunteer group, in‑person briefings, recognition messages, leadership meetings.[^1_1]

### Highest‑impact channels

- Volunteer landing page + role descriptions
    - Purpose: Explain why to volunteer, what roles exist, time commitment, expectations.[^1_1]
    - Impact: Very **high** (filters serious interest, reduces no‑shows), Effort: Medium.
- Volunteer sign‑up form + confirmation \& reminder messages
    - Purpose: Turn intention into actual first shift.[^1_1]
    - Impact: High on first‑time volunteer attendance, Effort: Low–Medium (form design + basic automation).
- WhatsApp volunteer group + structured pre‑shift briefings
    - Purpose: Reduce confusion, increase confidence during first shift.[^1_1]
    - Impact: High on satisfaction/retention, Effort: Medium (simple check‑in scripts, recurring brief).
- Recognition and growth touchpoints (messages, small shout‑outs, invite to leadership track)
    - Purpose: Prevent burnout, create long‑term event leaders.[^1_1]
    - Impact: High on retention, Effort: Low–Medium (templates + simple cadence).


### Medium‑impact, lower‑effort support channels

- Social media and in‑person announcements to drive traffic to the volunteer page.[^1_1]

***

## 4. Priority matrix by journey and channel

Use this table as your “what to build first” list (H = high, M = medium, L = low).

### New devotee channels

| Channel | Journey stage | Impact | Effort | Priority |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Google Search + Maps profile | Awareness | H | M | H |
| Website “New here?” + FAQs | Consideration | H | M | H |
| Event detail + registration pages | Decision | H | M | H |
| In‑person welcome + WhatsApp invite | Event experience | H | M | H |
| Email newsletters/reminders | Repeat attendance | M | M | M |
| Social media reels/posts | Early awareness | M | M | M |

[^1_1]

### Donor channels

| Channel | Journey stage | Impact | Effort | Priority |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Donation landing page (impact content) | Consideration/Decision | H | M | H |
| Payment form + confirmation | Decision | H | M | H |
| Post‑donation thank‑you + impact emails | Experience/Retention | H | M | H |
| Personal outreach (major/recurring) | Loyalty/Advocacy | H | H | H (targeted) |
| Social media content with clear CTAs | Awareness | M | M | M |
| General email list building | Pre‑donor nurture | M | M | M |

[^1_1]

### Volunteer channels

| Channel | Journey stage | Impact | Effort | Priority |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Volunteer landing page + roles | Awareness/Consideration | H | M | H |
| Volunteer sign‑up form + confirmation | Decision | H | M | H |
| WhatsApp group + pre‑shift briefing | First shift/Experience | H | M | H |
| Recognition messages + growth path | Loyalty/Leadership | H | M | H |
| Social media + in‑person calls for help | Initial awareness | M | L–M | M |

[^1_1]

***

## 5. How to operationalize “impact over effort”

For each quarter, you can:

1. Pick 1–2 high‑impact channels per journey (rows with Priority = H).[^1_1]
2. Define one measurable KPI per chosen channel (e.g., new devotee event attendance, donation completion rate, first‑shift show‑up rate).[^1_1]
3. Implement the lightest‑weight change that moves that metric (shorter forms, clearer copy, simple automation) before doing any new campaigns.[^1_1]

If you’d like, share your current tech stack (website platform, email tool, WhatsApp usage), and I can turn this into a very specific implementation backlog for the next 4–6 weeks.

# [https://www.jkyog.org/](https://www.jkyog.org/)

here is the current website

For your three journeys, the current site gives you strong top‑level assets but weak, scattered entry points for “New here?”, “Donate”, and “Volunteer.”

Below is how I’d map channels → journeys → near‑term priorities specifically for jkyog.org.

***

## 1. New devotee: where to route them

Right now the homepage is Swamiji‑centric and app‑centric; it doesn’t clearly answer “I’m new, what do I do next?” for a local temple visitor.

**Best channels for this journey**

- Homepage hero + one “New to JKYog?” CTA
    - Add a clear button like “New to our temple? Start here” that leads to a simple landing page with: what JKYog is, how to attend satsang/temple, how to find a nearby center, what to expect at a first visit.
- Navigation bar item for “Temple \& Events”
    - Make sure local temples/events are easy to find from the top nav, not buried under generic content.
- Local “Find a Center / Temple” page
    - One page listing cities/temples with maps, timings, dress code, parking, kids info, etc.

**Impact vs. effort for new devotees**


| Change | Impact | Effort | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Add “New to JKYog?” CTA + landing page | High | Medium | Converts generic traffic into temple seekers. |
| Clear “Temple/Find Us” nav item | High | Low | Simple IA/menu change. |
| Local center info (service times, FAQs) | High | Medium | Can reuse content across centers with variations. |

[^2_1]

***

## 2. Donor journey: where to send donors from the site

The homepage copy is about Swamiji and the AI Bhakti app; donor CTAs are not immediately visible or impact‑focused.

**Best channels for this journey**

- Persistent “Donate” in top navigation
    - Make sure “Donate” is always visible, and the donate page is clean, trustworthy, and impact‑oriented.
- Dedicated donation landing page(s)
    - One general “Support JKYog” page showing: what donations fund (temples, education, seva, digital outreach), stories/photos, options (one‑time, recurring, sponsorships).
- Post‑donation confirmation page + email
    - Simple, branded thank‑you page and email that explains next steps, impact, and how to stay connected (newsletter, WhatsApp, events).

**Impact vs. effort for donors**


| Change | Impact | Effort | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Make “Donate” highly visible in header/footer | High | Low | Instant clarity for supporters. |
| Create impact‑driven donation page | High | Medium | Core asset for all campaigns. |
| Improve confirmation page + email | High | Medium | Directly boosts trust and repeat giving. |

[^2_1]

***

## 3. Volunteer journey: where to send volunteers

The current site leans to “consume content” and “use the app”; it doesn’t yet behave like a recruiting hub for local volunteers.[^2_1]

**Best channels for this journey**

- “Serve / Volunteer” item in navigation
    - A clear “Serve” or “Volunteer” link that goes to one main volunteer landing page.
- Volunteer landing page
    - Why volunteer with JKYog, areas of service (events, temple operations, media, kids, tech, etc.), time expectations, simple interest form.
- Volunteer interest form + automated responses
    - Short form embedded on that page (name, city, WhatsApp, interests, availability) that triggers an auto “thank you + next step” email/WhatsApp and notifies the local coordinator.

**Impact vs. effort for volunteers**


| Change | Impact | Effort | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Add “Serve/Volunteer” to nav | High | Low | Creates a clear front door. |
| Build volunteer landing page with role snapshots | High | Medium | Directly feeds all centers’ needs. |
| Embed short interest form + auto reply | High | Medium | Reduces manual back‑and‑forth. |

[^2_1]

***

## 4. Cross‑journey channels to prioritize first

Across all three journeys, these website‑level pieces will give the biggest lift for the least engineering/content effort:


| Asset / Channel | Journeys served | Impact | Effort | Priority |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Clear top‑nav CTAs: New Here, Donate, Serve | New devotee, donor, volunteer | Very high | Low | 1 |
| New‑here landing page | New devotee | High | Medium | 2 |
| Impact‑oriented Donate page | Donor | High | Medium | 2 |
| Volunteer landing page + form | Volunteer | High | Medium | 2 |

[^2_1]

If you share what parts of the site you can edit yourself (WordPress pages vs. hard‑coded nav, forms provider, etc.), I can convert this into a 2–3 sprint task list with exact sections and copy blocks you can plug in.

# also utilize the whatsapp channel for the donor and volunteer journey map

WhatsApp fits naturally into both donor and volunteer journeys as a high‑impact, relatively low‑effort channel if you keep it opt‑in, concise, and linked to the right pages.[^3_1][^3_2][^3_3][^3_4]

***

## 1. Donor journey + WhatsApp

Think of WhatsApp as a mid– to late‑funnel and retention channel, not the main “discovery” channel.

### Where WhatsApp plugs into your donor map

Use WhatsApp at these stages:[^3_4]

- Consideration
    - Opt‑in entry points: “Get updates on WhatsApp” on donation pages, event pages, and email footers.[^3_5][^3_1]
    - Content: short impact stories (1–3 lines + image), links directly to your donation page, answers to common donation FAQs.
- Decision (donation moment)
    - Campaign broadcasts: for specific appeals (festival seva, building fund, youth programs) with a single clear CTA link to the correct donation form.[^3_6][^3_5]
    - Micro‑appeals: “We’re 80% to our Janmashtami goal—can you help us cross the finish line?” with exact remaining goal and link.[^3_7][^3_6]
- Post‑donation / loyalty
    - Instant thank‑you message (if they opted in) with: gratitude, brief impact line, and link to a 1–2 minute video from Swamiji or beneficiaries.[^3_8][^3_1]
    - Periodic impact updates: monthly or quarterly stories, photos, short videos—NOT constant asks.[^3_9][^3_1][^3_7]
    - Gentle renewal nudges: “Your monthly gurukul sponsorship is making this possible” + renewal or upgrade link.[^3_2][^3_6]


### Donor WhatsApp flows to implement

- Flow 1: Opt‑in → segmented list
    - Add a checkbox or toggle on donation forms: “Send me impact updates on WhatsApp.”
    - Tag donors by campaign or theme (temple construction, youth, satsang) and send tailored messages.[^3_10][^3_7][^3_9]
- Flow 2: Automated thank‑you + receipt link
    - On successful donation, trigger a WhatsApp template: “Thank you for your seva of \$X for [campaign]. Here’s how it helps: … Link to full impact page/receipt.”[^3_8][^3_9]
- Flow 3: High‑touch for major donors
    - Use 1:1 WhatsApp voice notes or short videos from a leader, inviting them to special satsangs or briefings.[^3_1][^3_10][^3_8]

**Impact vs. effort (donors + WhatsApp)**


| WhatsApp use case | Impact | Effort | Priority |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Opt‑in on donation forms | High | Low | H |
| Auto thank‑you + impact snippet | High | Medium | H |
| Campaign‑specific broadcasts | Medium | Medium | M |
| 1:1 major donor voice notes/videos | High | Medium | H (targeted) |

[^3_6][^3_7][^3_9][^3_10][^3_4][^3_1][^3_8]

***

## 2. Volunteer journey + WhatsApp

WhatsApp is ideal for moving people from “I’m interested” to “I actually show up and come back,” which lines up with the pain points in your volunteer map.[^3_11][^3_3][^3_2][^3_4]

### Where WhatsApp plugs into your volunteer map

Use WhatsApp at these stages:[^3_4]

- Awareness → Consideration
    - Entry: QR codes at temple/events, website “Volunteer” page button: “Message us VOLUNTEER on WhatsApp to get started.”[^3_2]
    - Micro‑intake: bot or person asks 3–4 quick questions (city, availability, interest area) instead of a long form.[^3_11][^3_2]
- Decision (first shift)
    - Confirmation: send role, date, time, location pin, dress code, and “who to find when you arrive.”[^3_11][^3_2]
    - Reminder: 24 hours before and the morning of, with an easy “Yes/Can’t make it” quick reply.[^3_3][^3_11]
- Event experience
    - Group coordination: a WhatsApp group for each event/team (setup, prasad, parking, kids) with live instructions and quick reassignment if needed.[^3_3][^3_4][^3_11]
    - On‑the‑spot help: volunteers can ask questions without leaving their station.
- Loyalty / leadership
    - Recognition: share photos, appreciation messages, and short notes from Swamiji or leaders in the group after events.[^3_10][^3_1][^3_4]
    - Growth path: message individuals with invitations to take on more responsibility or join planning calls.[^3_2][^3_4][^3_11]


### Volunteer WhatsApp flows to implement

- Flow 1: “VOLUNTEER” keyword journey
    - Entry from QR or website → WhatsApp message “VOLUNTEER” → auto questions for city, availability, preferred seva → tag in a sheet/CRM.[^3_11][^3_2]
- Flow 2: Shift assignment + reminders
    - Once assigned, add them to the specific event group or send them a direct template with date/time/role → reminder 24h before → quick post‑event “Thank you + 1‑question feedback.”[^3_3][^3_11]
- Flow 3: Community \& retention
    - A stable “Core Volunteers – [City]” group for ongoing announcements and spiritual encouragement, plus event‑specific groups that are archived afterward.[^3_2][^3_3][^3_11]

**Impact vs. effort (volunteers + WhatsApp)**


| WhatsApp use case | Impact | Effort | Priority |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| QR → VOLUNTEER intake on WhatsApp | High | Medium | H |
| Automated confirmations + reminders | Very high | Medium | H |
| Event‑specific coordination groups | High | Low | H |
| Core volunteer community/recognition | High | Low | H |

[^3_10][^3_4][^3_3][^3_11][^3_2]

***

## 3. Where WhatsApp sits vs. your other channels

For both donor and volunteer journeys, WhatsApp should:

- Catch people **after** they discover you via website, events, social, or YouTube.[^3_4][^3_3][^3_2]
- Reduce friction at key conversion points (donation, first shift) with direct links and reminders.[^3_5][^3_6][^3_4][^3_11]
- Deepen the relationship with human, two‑way, light‑touch communication rather than mass, text‑heavy blasts.[^3_7][^3_1][^3_5][^3_10]

If you tell me whether you’re using WhatsApp Business (app or API) and any tools (e.g., Twilio, AiSensy, Interakt, etc.), I can propose exact message templates for each journey stage that your team can start sending this month.

# now i need help curating Channel-specific content guidelines

Here’s a compact set of channel‑specific content guidelines you can apply across temple, donor, and volunteer journeys, with WhatsApp included.

***

## 1. Website content guidelines

Purpose: “Source of truth” for information, deep explanations, forms, and next steps.

- Tone \& style
    - Warm, welcoming, simple language, minimal Sanskrit/Hindi without explanation.
    - Focus on **benefits** to the user: peace, community, seva, clarity in life.
- Structure
    - Clear headings (“New here?”, “Donate”, “Serve/Volunteer”).
    - Short paragraphs, bullet lists, prominent buttons for actions (Visit, Register, Donate, Volunteer).
    - Always answer: What is this? Who is it for? What do I do now?
- By journey
    - New devotees: FAQs (“What to expect on first visit?”, dress code, timings, kids, parking), short story of the temple, photos of satsang/prasad/children.
    - Donors: what donations support, impact stats/stories, transparent use of funds, options (one‑time, recurring, sponsorships).
    - Volunteers: why seva matters, role snapshots, time expectations, simple interest form.

***

## 2. Social media content guidelines (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube short captions)

Purpose: Awareness, inspiration, light education; drive to website/events/WhatsApp.

- Tone \& style
    - Short, visual, emotionally resonant; clear **one** CTA per post.
    - Mix of spiritual wisdom, real community moments, and invitations.
- Content mix
    - New devotees: short reels of kirtan, darshan, kids’ activities; “Come experience this in person” with date/time/link.
    - Donors: before/after stories, “Your support made this possible”, festival seva appeals with clear links.
    - Volunteers: behind‑the‑scenes seva clips, volunteer spotlights, “We need 10 volunteers for [event] – comment or message ‘VOLUNTEER’.”
- Best practices
    - Always include link or clear next step (bio link, landing page, WhatsApp keyword).
    - Avoid text-heavy graphics; use 2–3 key lines max.
    - Respect privacy, especially for children; get consent before featuring individuals.

***

## 3. Email content guidelines

Purpose: Deeper nurture, impact reporting, structured invitations.

- Tone \& style
    - More detailed than social, but still scannable; friendly, personal, not “corporate”.
    - Subject lines that highlight value: “How your seva helped 50 children this month” vs. “Monthly newsletter.”
- Structure
    - Top section: 1 main story or update.
    - Middle: 2–3 short items (upcoming events, opportunities to give/serve).
    - Bottom: clear CTAs (Visit, Register, Donate, Volunteer, Join WhatsApp).
- By journey
    - New devotees: welcome series (“What JKYog stands for”, “How to get involved locally”, “Recommended first events”).
    - Donors: impact stories, transparent numbers, occasional specific asks tied to campaigns.
    - Volunteers: event briefings, role explanations, thank‑you recaps, leadership invites.

***

## 4. WhatsApp content guidelines (donor + volunteer focus)

Purpose: High‑touch, short, action‑oriented and relational communication.

- General rules
    - Always opt‑in; clarify what they’ll receive (“occasional updates and seva opportunities”).
    - Short, skimmable messages; avoid large paragraphs.
    - Respect quiet hours; avoid spamming; default to 1–4 messages/month per list.


### Donor‑specific WhatsApp guidelines

- Message types
    - Thank‑you: “Thank you for your seva of \$X for [cause]. Here is one line on impact + link to a photo/video.”
    - Impact updates: 1–2 lines + image, 1–2 times/month at most.
    - Appeals: clearly time‑bound (festival, project milestone) with one link and specific goal.
- Tone \& boundaries
    - Gratitude‑first; ask comes second.
    - Avoid guilt or pressure; emphasize opportunity and shared mission.
    - Keep 1:1 messages for major/recurring donors personal (voice note, short custom text), not copy‑pasted campaign blasts.


### Volunteer‑specific WhatsApp guidelines

- Message types
    - Intake: auto or manual short questions (city, interest area, availability).
    - Shift info: date, time, location pin, dress code, contact person; 24‑hour reminder.
    - On‑event: concise instructions, role changes, appreciation, not long lectures.
    - Post‑event: “Thank you”, 1 photo, and 1 simple feedback question or next opportunity.
- Tone \& boundaries
    - Clear and encouraging: “Please arrive by 4:30 pm so we can brief you and serve smoothly together.”
    - Avoid flooding groups; pin key info, use emojis sparingly if you choose, and discourage off‑topic chatter.
    - Respect privacy; avoid sharing personal issues or internal conflicts in groups.

***

## 5. In‑person \& print content guidelines

Purpose: Support digital journeys at physical events/temple.

- In‑person
    - Greeters with one‑line welcome and clear directions; offer QR codes for “New here?”, “Donate online”, “Volunteer” that lead to your key landing pages or WhatsApp flows.
    - Announcements that always answer: what, when, where, and how to sign up or give.
- Print (posters, handouts, standees)
    - One main message per piece (e.g., “New here? Scan to get started” or “Serve with us”).
    - Large QR codes linked to the right digital journeys; minimal text, strong images.

***

## 6. Simple content checklist per channel

You can quickly evaluate any piece of content with this:

- Website: Is it clear what this page is about and what the visitor should do next?
- Social: Can someone understand and act in under 5 seconds of attention?
- Email: Is there one main story and 1–3 clear CTAs?
- WhatsApp: Is this short, helpful, and something I’d be okay receiving on my own phone?
- In‑person/print: Does it push people toward the right digital step (visit, donate, volunteer, join WhatsApp)?

If you’d like, next step can be: I help you draft example content for each channel for one specific campaign (e.g., “New devotee welcome,” “Festival fundraising,” or “Big upcoming event volunteer recruitment”).

# now help me curate a 2-week content calendar template, i dont want it to be too specific to JKYog because i might need to reuse it for other purposes

Here’s a reusable 2‑week content calendar template tailored for spiritual/religious organizations, but generic enough to repurpose anywhere. You can plug in your own campaigns, festivals, or themes.

***

## 1. Overall structure

Assumptions (adjust freely):

- Channels: Website, Email, Social (IG/FB/YouTube shorts), WhatsApp (Donor \& Volunteer), In‑person.
- Main goals in any 2‑week sprint:
    - Bring new people in (awareness/visit).
    - Nurture \& teach (spiritual content).
    - Activate giving (donation).
    - Activate service (volunteering).

Use **one primary focus per week** (e.g., Week 1: New attendees; Week 2: Seva \& donations) so content feels coherent, not scattered.

***

## 2. Calendar layout (template)

You can recreate this in a spreadsheet or Notion with columns:

- Date
- Theme / Focus
- Channel (Website / Social / Email / WhatsApp Donor / WhatsApp Volunteer / In‑person)
- Content angle (what you’ll say)
- CTA (what you want them to do)
- Owner
- Status

Below is a sample 2‑week grid with fill‑in‑the‑blank prompts.

### Week 1 – Focus: New attendees \& basic engagement

**Day 1 (Mon)**

- Social: Post 1
    - Theme: “Welcome / Why this community exists.”
    - Content angle: Short quote or teaching + image from community life.
    - CTA: “Follow for more” or “Visit [day/time]”.
- Website (if needed):
    - Small update: ensure upcoming events for next 2 weeks are clearly visible.

**Day 2 (Tue)**

- WhatsApp (Volunteer or Devotee updates):
    - Theme: “Upcoming event teaser.”
    - Content angle: 1–2 lines about an upcoming satsang/event.
    - CTA: “Save the date” or link to details/registration.

**Day 3 (Wed)**

- Social: Post 2
    - Theme: “Learning / Teaching snippet.”
    - Content angle: Short spiritual insight (1–3 lines) with a simple visual.
    - CTA: “Read more / watch more” link (optional).

**Day 4 (Thu)**

- Email (short newsletter or micro‑update)
    - Theme: “This week at [Organization]”.
    - Content angle: 1 main highlight + 2 short bullets (event, class, or satsang).
    - CTA: “Register for [event]” or “Plan your visit”.

**Day 5 (Fri)**

## 4. How to reuse this for other purposes

To adapt this template:

- Swap the **focus**:
    - Festivals, retreats, youth programs, specific campaigns, etc.
- Swap the **audience emphasis** per week:
    - Week X: Newcomers; Week Y: Youth; Week Z: Families; etc.
- Keep the **rhythm**:
    - 2–3 social posts/week, 1 email/week, 1–2 WhatsApp touchpoints/week, weekly in‑person mentions.

If you tell me your main goal for the next 2 weeks (e.g., “fill an event,” “grow WhatsApp list,” or “launch a new class”), I can plug that goal into this template and give you one “filled‑out” version as an example.
