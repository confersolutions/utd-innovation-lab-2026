# Task 4 – Goal and Findings

## Goal of Task 4

The goal of this task was to design and document a high-level integration architecture for a multi-channel AI chatbot system.

This included:

- Understanding how users from different platforms (web, WhatsApp, voice) interact with a centralized system.
- Planning how the chatbot connects to backend systems such as events, donations, contact forms, and CRM.
- Designing a shared architecture that supports multiple websites without duplicating logic.
- Creating structured documentation that clearly explains the full system flow.

This task focused on research, architectural planning, and documentation only. No implementation was performed.

## Key Findings

### 1. Need for a Layered Architecture

A scalable system requires clear separation of responsibilities.

The architecture was divided into:

- Users Layer
- Channel Layer
- Automation / Orchestration Layer
- Bot Core Engine
- Backend APIs Layer

This separation ensures maintainability, scalability, and clarity in system design.

### 2. Shared Bot Core with Site Context Routing

Instead of building separate bots for each website, a shared AI core can be used.

The system dynamically routes responses based on the originating website context.  
This allows:

- Reuse of conversational logic
- Separation of knowledge bases
- Reduced duplication
- Easier maintenance

---

### 3. Importance of Channel Abstraction

Each platform communicates differently.

To handle this, a Channel Layer is required that:

- Converts incoming messages into a standardized format
- Ensures consistent internal processing
- Supports Web Chat, WhatsApp, and Voice input

---

### 4. Backend Integration is Essential

The chatbot must perform real actions beyond answering questions.

Required integrations include:

- Events management
- Donation processing
- Contact form submission
- Newsletter subscription
- CRM integration

These integrations allow the chatbot to connect with real operational systems.

---

### 5. Context Management is Required

A session store is necessary to retain user context during conversations.

This ensures the bot can understand follow-up inputs and maintain coherent multi-step interactions.

---

## Summary

The goal was to design how the entire system connects across multiple platforms and backend services.

The findings show that a centralized bot core, layered architecture, channel abstraction, and structured backend integration are essential for building a scalable and maintainable solution.
