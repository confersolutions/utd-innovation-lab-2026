Task 4 – Integration Architecture Research Log

Nikita
Task $: System Integration & High-Level Architecture Planning


Overview:
This log documents the research, planning, and documentation work completed for Task 4. The focus of this task was to design and document the high-level system architecture for the multi-channel AI chatbot system. This is not a final implementation. It reflects research, system thinking, and structured planning.

Work Completed:

1. Researched Multi-Channel Bot Architecture
   - Studied how chatbot systems handle multiple input channels such as web, WhatsApp, and voice.
   - Identified the need for a unified backend system that processes messages consistently across platforms.
   - Analyzed how channel abstraction layers work (Web SDK, Webhooks, Voice connectors).

2. Designed High-Level System Flow
   - Created a structured flow from user entry points to backend systems.
   - Defined logical layers:
     • Users Layer
     • Channel Layer
     • Automation / Orchestration Layer
     • Bot Core Engine
     • Backend APIs
   - Ensured separation of concerns between message intake, intelligence processing, and data execution.

3. Defined Bot Core Components
   - Identified the core intelligence components:
     • LLM / NLU for intent detection
     • Dialog Manager for conversation flow
     • Knowledge Base Router for site-specific responses
     • Session Store for maintaining user context
   - Planned how shared logic can support multiple websites using site_context routing.

4. Planned Site Context Routing Strategy
   - Proposed shared bot core with contextual routing.
   - Designed system logic where knowledge base and responses vary based on originating website.
   - Ensured reusability of AI engine while maintaining content separation.

5. Identified Backend Integration Requirements
   - Listed required backend APIs:
     • Events
     • Donations
     • Contact Forms
     • Newsletter
     • CRM integration
   - Mapped how chatbot actions trigger API calls.
   - Documented data flow between bot system and external services.

6. Created Integration Architecture Documentation
   - Structured architecture diagram in markdown format.
   - Wrote layer-by-layer explanation of system design.
   - Ensured documentation is clear for technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Current Status:
Research and architectural planning phase completed.
Documentation created and structured in integration-architecture.md file.
No deployment or implementation performed at this stage.

Next Steps (Future Work – Not Completed in This Task):
- Technical stack selection
- API specification definition
- Deployment architecture planning
- Security and authentication design
- Scalability testing strategy
