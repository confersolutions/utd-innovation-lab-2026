# JKYog WhatsApp Bot — Voice-to-WhatsApp Scripts (Team 4A, Week 3)
Owner: Chanakya Alluri  
Due: March 6, 2026 (11:59 PM CST)

## 0) Purpose
These scripts handle:
1) Transition from a **voice call** (IVR/voice bot) into **WhatsApp chat** with the JKYog bot  
2) Five **error/fallback scenarios** (user-safe messaging + recovery prompts)

Tone: respectful, calm, devotional-friendly, minimal friction.

## 2) Voice-to-WhatsApp Handoff — Core Flows

### Flow A: Standard Handoff (User agrees + has WhatsApp)
**Goal:** Send user a WhatsApp link and confirm next steps.

**VOICE SCRIPT (Agent)**
1) Greeting + capability  
> “Namaste! I can help with temple timings, directions, and donations. For faster support and links, I can continue on WhatsApp.”

2) Consent check  
> “Would you like me to send you a WhatsApp message now? Please say **Yes** or **No**.”

**If YES**
3) Confirm number (optional if caller ID available)  
> “Great. I will send the message to the number you’re calling from. Is that okay?”

- If user says “No”:  
> “Please tell me the 10-digit mobile number you want to use for WhatsApp.”

4) Set expectation  
> “Perfect. You’ll receive a WhatsApp message in a few seconds. Please open it and reply **Hi** to begin.”

5) Closure  
> “I’ll stay on the line for 10 seconds—if you don’t receive it, I can resend.”

**WHATSAPP MESSAGE (System / Bot)**  
> “Namaste 🙏 Welcome to {TEMPLE_NAME}.  
Reply **Hi** to start.  
You can ask about:  
1) Temple timings & events  
2) Directions & parking  
3) Donations & receipts”

**Recovery button (if supported)**
- Quick Replies: `Hi` | `Menu` | `Talk to a volunteer`

---

### Flow B: Handoff via “User-initiated WhatsApp” (No outbound message allowed)
**When:** Policies/stack cannot send proactive WhatsApp message; user must start chat.

**VOICE SCRIPT**  
> “To continue on WhatsApp, please message us first.  
Open WhatsApp and send **Hi** to this number: **{WHATSAPP_NUMBER}**.  
You can also use this link: **{WA_LINK}**.”

> “Once you send **Hi**, our WhatsApp bot will guide you.”

**WHATSAPP FIRST MESSAGE (User -> Bot):** “Hi”

**BOT REPLY**  
> “Namaste 🙏 You’re connected to {TEMPLE_NAME}.  
How can I help today?  
1) Visitor info (timings, events)  
2) Directions (parking, transit)  
3) Donations (receipt, recurring)”

---

### Flow C: Link + Short Code Verification (Optional, for continuity)
**When:** You want to connect voice session `{CASE_ID}` to WhatsApp chat.

**VOICE SCRIPT**  
> “I’m sending a WhatsApp link now.  
To continue where we left off, please enter this code in WhatsApp: **{SHORT_CODE}**.”

**WHATSAPP MESSAGE**  
> “Namaste 🙏 To continue your call on WhatsApp, reply with this code: **{SHORT_CODE}**.”

**BOT AFTER CODE**  
> “Thank you! I’ve restored your context.  
Do you want help with:  
1) Visitor info  
2) Directions  
3) Donations  
Type 1, 2, or 3.”

**If wrong code**  
> “Hmm—this code doesn’t match. Please try again, or type **Start** to begin fresh.”

---

### Flow D: User declines WhatsApp (Continue on voice)
**VOICE SCRIPT**  
> “No problem. I can still help here on the call.  
Please tell me what you need:  
1) Temple timings & events  
2) Directions & parking  
3) Donations & receipts”

---

### Flow E: User says “I don’t have WhatsApp”
**VOICE SCRIPT**  
> “Understood. I can help on this call.  
If you’d like directions or donation links later, you can also check our website or we can connect you to a volunteer during {HOURS}.”

(If you have a public website)  
> “You can also visit the temple page for details.”

---

## 3) Five Error / Fallback Scenarios (User Messages + Recovery)

### Error 1: Intent Not Understood
**When:** The user’s message/call input doesn’t match known intents confidently.

**VOICE (Gentle clarification)**  
> “Sorry, I didn’t fully understand that.  
Are you asking about **timings/events**, **directions**, or **donations**?”

**WhatsApp**  
> “Sorry—I may have missed that. 🙏  
Please choose one:  
1) Timings & events  
2) Directions & parking  
3) Donations & receipts  
Or type **Menu**.”

**Recovery logic**
- Retry classification once  
- If still unclear → offer examples:  
  - “Try: ‘What time is aarti?’ / ‘How do I reach the temple?’ / ‘I need a donation receipt’”

---

### Error 2: API Timeout (Backend didn’t respond)
**When:** Maps/CRM/KB/receipt service times out.

**VOICE**  
> “One moment—our system is taking longer than usual.  
I can try again, or I can continue this on WhatsApp for faster links. What do you prefer?”

**WhatsApp**  
> “I’m having trouble reaching our system right now. 🙏  
Please try again in a moment.  
- Type **Retry** to try again  
- Type **Menu** to choose a different option  
- Type **Human** to request a volunteer”

**Recovery logic**
- Auto-retry once after 3–5 seconds  
- If second timeout → offer human escalation + log failure

---

### Error 3: Confusing User Input (Mixed details / ambiguous)
**When:** User sends multiple requests or unclear data (e.g., “tomorrow parking donation receipt”).

**VOICE**  
> “I heard a few things together. Let’s do one at a time.  
What would you like first: **directions**, **timings**, or **donations**?”

**WhatsApp**  
> “Got it—there are a few things in your message. 🙏  
What should we do first?  
1) Timings/events  
2) Directions/parking  
3) Donations/receipt”

**Recovery logic**
- Ask a single-choice question  
- Maintain previous message as context note, but proceed stepwise

---

### Error 4: Context Lost (Session reset / user returns later)
**When:** Bot lost state, WhatsApp reopened, or long gap.

**VOICE**  
> “Welcome back. I may have lost our earlier context.  
Please tell me what you need now: timings, directions, or donations.”

**WhatsApp**  
> “Welcome back 🙏 I may have lost the last step.  
Please type one:  
- **Timings**  
- **Directions**  
- **Donations**  
Or type **Start** to begin again.”

**Recovery logic**
- Provide “Start” + “Menu”  
- If user uses keywords, route accordingly  
- If user previously had `{CASE_ID}` and it’s recoverable → attempt restore silently

---

### Error 5: Failed Escalation to Human (No agent available / handoff failed)
**When:** Volunteer/agent not reachable, shift ended, or handoff integration fails.

**VOICE**  
> “I’m sorry—no volunteer is available right now.  
I can still help with basic info here, or you can try again during {HOURS}.  
Would you like **timings**, **directions**, or **donations**?”

**WhatsApp**  
> “I’m sorry—our volunteer team isn’t available right now. 🙏  
I can still help here, or you can try again during {HOURS}.  
Meanwhile, choose:  
1) Timings/events  
2) Directions/parking  
3) Donations/receipt  
Or type **Leave a message**.”

**Recovery logic**
- Offer async message capture (if supported):  
  - collect name + question + preferred callback  
- Otherwise provide self-serve menu + hours

---

## 4) WhatsApp “Safety Nets” (Always Available Commands)
At any time, user can type:
- **Menu** → show main options
- **Start** → reset flow
- **Human** → request volunteer (with hours fallback)
- **Language** → language switch (handled by Nikita’s logic)

**Menu message**  
> “Namaste 🙏 Main Menu  
1) Visitor info (timings, events)  
2) Directions (parking, transit)  
3) Donations (receipt, recurring)  
Type 1, 2, or 3.”

---

## 5) Optional: Hindi + Gujarati Variants (Short)
(Use if language is detected or user requests)

### Hindi (WHATSAPP)
- Intent not understood:  
> “माफ़ कीजिए 🙏 मैं समझ नहीं पाया।  
कृपया चुनें:  
1) समय/कार्यक्रम  
2) दिशा/पार्किंग  
3) दान/रसीद  
या **Menu** लिखें।”

### Gujarati (WHATSAPP)
- Intent not understood:  
> “માફ કરશો 🙏 મને સમજી ન પડ્યું.  
કૃપા કરીને પસંદ કરો:  
1) સમય/કાર્યક્રમ  
2) દિશા/પાર્કિંગ  
3) દાન/રસીદ  
અથવા **Menu** લખો।”

---

## 6) Implementation Notes (Handoff Logic Summary)
- If outbound WhatsApp is permitted:
  - Send WhatsApp message with `{WA_LINK}` + welcome + quick options
- If outbound not permitted:
  - Use “user-initiated” flow and provide number + wa.me link
- If continuity is required:
  - Use `{SHORT_CODE}` and bind voice session `{CASE_ID}` to WhatsApp session
- Always provide:
  - Menu/Start commands
  - Human escalation with hours fallback
  - Single-choice recovery prompts for ambiguous inputs
