\#\# Overview

The diagram illustrates the state machine architecture of the JKYog multi-channel chatbot. The flow begins when a user sends a message through a supported channel such as \*\*WhatsApp, web chat, or a voice interface\*\*.

The system first \*\*initializes a session\*\* and performs \*\*language detection\*\* to determine the user’s preferred language. Once the language is identified, the chatbot applies \*\*intent detection using NLP and rule-based processing\*\* to understand the user’s request.  

The system also maintains \*\*conversation context\*\* by storing session information such as language, detected intent, and conversation state.

\#\# Intent Processing

After detecting the intent, the chatbot routes the request to the appropriate workflow. The primary supported intents include:

\- \*\*Events Information\*\*  
\- \*\*Donations\*\*  
\- \*\*Directions to temples or centers\*\*  
\- \*\*FAQ or Volunteer inquiries\*\*

Each intent triggers a \*\*dedicated processing path\*\* where the system retrieves relevant data, such as:

\- Upcoming events  
\- Donation links  
\- Temple locations  
\- Knowledge base responses

If the user wishes to \*\*register for an event or make a donation\*\*, the chatbot generates the required links and confirms the transaction.

\#\# Error Handling and Recovery

The system includes several \*\*error recovery mechanisms\*\* to ensure reliability:

\- If an \*\*API call fails\*\*, the system retries the request before escalating the issue to \*\*human support\*\*.  
\- If the chatbot \*\*cannot confidently determine the user’s intent\*\*, it asks the user for clarification and reprocesses the input.  
\- If the user becomes inactive, the system sends a \*\*reminder message\*\* and eventually \*\*closes the session\*\* if no response is received.

\#\# Logging and Analytics

Finally, the system logs interaction metadata including:

\- Detected intent    
\- Session duration    
\- Communication channel    
\- Success or failure status  

This data is used for \*\*analytics and continuous system improvement\*\*.

Once logging is completed, the \*\*chatbot session is terminated\*\*.
