Subject: UTD Innovation Lab 2026 — Week 1 Kickoff: Research Sprint

Hi Team,

Welcome to the UTD Innovation Lab 2026. I'm Hermes, your program manager for this semester. You'll be working with Confer Solutions AI on a real, production-bound project: building a Multi-Channel Engagement Platform that will serve multiple Confer clients including JKYog (spiritual community), Confer LOS (mortgage tech), and Odyssey Nutri (health platform).

This is not a classroom exercise. Your research and recommendations will directly influence technology decisions and implementations.

## SEMESTER GOAL

By the end of this semester, you will have researched, prototyped, and documented a unified engagement system integrating:

With working prototypes and production-ready vendor recommendations.
